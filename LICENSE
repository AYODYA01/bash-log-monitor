# 5) CONTRIBUTING + Good repo hygiene
Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with short guidelines:
- How to report issues
- How to submit PRs (fork → branch → PR)
- Code style and script safety notes (e.g., don’t run as root unless necessary)

Add a simple `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` if you want.

---

# 6) Add topics & README badges on GitHub
- On the repo page, click **Manage topics** and add: `bash`, `shell`, `security`, `networking` etc.  
- Add a short badge for license, stars, or CI later.

---

# 7) Make your scripts safe & documented
- Use `set -euo pipefail` where appropriate  
- Validate inputs and warn about required permissions  
- Add comments to your scripts and usage examples

Example header for scripts:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Simple Network Scanner
# Author: Your Name
# Usage: ./scan.sh 192.168.1
